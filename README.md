# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-and-SMOTE
This project shows how to predict customer churn using a Random Forest classifier, while addressing class imbalance by the application of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). The dataset is preprocessed, categorical features are encoded, and feature engineering is performed. The model is evaluated using accuracy scores, and various visualizations are created to understand the relationships between features like MonthlyCharges, InternetService, and Churn.
